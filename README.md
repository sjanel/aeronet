**aeronet** is a modern, fast, modular and ergonomic HTTP/1.1 C++ server library for Linux focused on predictable performance, explicit control and minimal dependencies.

## Key Benefits (5× high‑level)

- Fast & predictable: edge‑triggered epoll, zero/low‑allocation hot paths, horizontal scaling via SO_REUSEPORT.
- Safe by default: strict parsing, size/time guards, optional TLS & compression with defensive limits.
- Modular & opt‑in: enable only the features you need (zlib, zstd, brotli, TLS, logging) via build flags.
- Ergonomic minimal surface: simple `HttpServer`, `AsyncHttpServer`, `MultiHttpServer` types; fluent configuration; RAII listener setup.
- Extensible & observable: composable configs (compression, decompression, TLS) plus lightweight per‑request metrics hook.

## Minimal Example

Spin up a basic HTTP/1.1 server that responds on `/hello` in just a few lines. If you pass `0` as the port (or omit it), the kernel picks an ephemeral port which you can query immediately.

```cpp
#include <aeronet/aeronet.hpp>

using namespace aeronet;

int main() {
  HttpServer server(HttpServerConfig{}.withPort(0)); // 0 => ephemeral
  server.addPathHandler("/hello", http::MethodSet{http::Method::GET}, [](const HttpRequest&) {
    return HttpResponse(200, "OK").contentType("text/plain").body("hello from aeronet\n");
  });
  server.run(); // blocking
}
```

## Quick Start with provided examples

Minimal server examples are provided in [examples](examples) directory.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/examples/aeronet-minimal 8080   # or omit 8080 for ephemeral
```

Test with curl:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Length: 151
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Sun, 05 Oct 2025 09:08:14 GMT

Hello from aeronet minimal server! You requested /hello
Method: GET
Version: HTTP/1.1
Headers:
Accept: */*
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/8.5.0
```

## HTTP/1.1 Feature Matrix

Moved out of the landing page to keep things concise. See the full, continually updated matrices in:

- [HTTP/1.1 Feature Matrix](docs/FEATURES.md#http11-feature-matrix)
- [Performance / architecture](docs/FEATURES.md#performance--architecture)

### Connection Close Semantics (CloseMode)

Full details (modes, triggers, helpers) have been moved out of the landing page:
See: [Connection Close Semantics](docs/FEATURES.md#connection-close-semantics)

### Compression (gzip, deflate, zstd, brotli)

Detailed negotiation rules, thresholds, opt-outs, and tuning have moved:
See: [Compression & Negotiation](docs/FEATURES.md#compression--negotiation)

Per-response manual override: setting any `Content-Encoding` (even `identity`) disables automatic compression for that
response. Details & examples: [Manual Content-Encoding Override](docs/FEATURES.md#per-response-manual-content-encoding-automatic-compression-suppression)

### Inbound Request Body Decompression

Detailed multi-layer decoding behavior, safety limits, examples, and configuration moved here:
See: [Inbound Request Decompression](docs/FEATURES.md#inbound-request-decompression-config-details)

```cpp
server.setStreamingHandler([](const HttpRequest&, HttpResponseWriter& w){
  w.statusCode(200, "OK");
  w.contentType("text/plain");
  for (int i=0;i<10;++i) {
    w.write(std::string(50,'x')); // accumulates until threshold then switches to compressed chunks
  }
  w.end();
});
```

### Reserved Headers

The library intentionally reserves a small set of response headers that user code cannot set directly on
`HttpResponse` (fixed responses) or via `HttpResponseWriter` (streaming) because aeronet itself manages them or
their semantics would be invalid / ambiguous without deeper protocol features:

Reserved now (assert if attempted in debug; ignored in release for streaming):

- `Date` – generated once per second and injected automatically.
- `Content-Length` – computed from the body (fixed) or set through `contentLength()` (streaming). Prevents
  inconsistencies between declared and actual size.
- `Connection` – determined by keep-alive policy (HTTP version, server config, request count, errors). User code
  supplying conflicting values could desynchronize connection reuse logic.
- `Transfer-Encoding` – controlled by streaming writer (`chunked`) or omitted when `Content-Length` is known. Allowing
  arbitrary values risks illegal CL + TE combinations or unsupported encodings.
- `Trailer`, `TE`, `Upgrade` – not yet supported by aeronet; reserving them now avoids future backward-incompatible
  behavior changes when trailer / upgrade features are introduced.

Allowed convenience helpers:

- `Content-Type` via `contentType()` or `setHeader("Content-Type", ...)` in streaming.
- `Location` via `location()` for redirects.

All other headers (custom application / caching / CORS / etc.) may be freely set; they are forwarded verbatim.
This central rule lives in a single helper (`http::IsReservedResponseHeader`).

### Request Header Duplicate Handling

Detailed policy & implementation moved to: [Request Header Duplicate Handling](docs/FEATURES.md#request-header-duplicate-handling-detailed)

### Inbound Request Body Decompression (Content-Encoding)

Detailed behavior, limits & examples moved to: [Inbound Request Decompression](docs/FEATURES.md#inbound-request-decompression-config-details)

| Operation          | Complexity | Notes |
|--------------------|------------|-------|
| `statusCode()`     | O(1)       | Overwrites 3 digits |
| `reason()`         | O(trailing) | One tail `memmove` if size delta |
| `addCustomHeader()`| O(bodyLen) | Shift tail once; no scan |
| `customHeader()`   | O(headers + bodyLen) | Linear scan + maybe one shift |
| `body()`           | O(delta) + realloc | Exponential growth strategy |

Testing highlights:

- Header replacement: larger, smaller, same length, with and without body.
- Reason growth/shrink with headers present & absent (including removal to empty and re‑addition).
- Fuzz test generating random sequences of operations (status, reason, body, header additions & replacements).
- Safety test where `body()` receives a view referencing internal buffer memory (reallocation correctness).

Usage guidelines:

- Use `addCustomHeader()` when duplicates are acceptable or not possible from the client code (cheapest path).
- Use `customHeader()` only when you must guarantee uniqueness. Matching is case‑insensitive; prefer a canonical style (e.g.
  `Content-Type`) for readability, but behavior is the same regardless of input casing.
- Chain on temporaries for concise construction; the rvalue-qualified overloads keep the object movable.
- Finalize exactly once right before sending.

Future possible extensions (not yet implemented): transparent compression insertion, zero‑copy file send mapping,
and an alternate layout for extremely large header counts.

### MultiHttpServer Lifecycle, Restart Semantics & reusePort Requirement

`MultiHttpServer` constructs all underlying `HttpServer` instances immediately. If `cfg.port == 0` (ephemeral) the
first underlying server binds and resolves the concrete port during construction, so `multi.port()` is valid right
after the constructor returns. `start()` only launches the event loop threads – no busy-wait for port discovery.

Restartability:

- You may call `stop()` and then `start()` again on the same `MultiHttpServer` instance.
- A restart creates a brand new set of underlying `HttpServer` objects because an `HttpServer` is currently single‑shot
  (its `stop()` closes the listening socket; it does not rebind in place). This keeps the restart path simple and
  avoids subtle epoll/listener reinitialization races.
- Ephemeral port reuse: if the initial construction used `port=0`, the kernel-chosen port is stored in the resolved
  config and that SAME port is reused for all subsequent restarts by default. Restarts do not request a new ephemeral
  port automatically. (Design choice: stable port across cycles is usually what supervisors / load balancers expect.)
  To obtain a new ephemeral port you must construct a new `MultiHttpServer` (or in a future API explicitly reset
  the base configuration before a restart to `port=0`).
- Handlers: global or path handlers registered before the first `start()` are re-applied to the fresh servers on each
  restart. You may add/remove/replace path handlers and/or the global handler while the server is STOPPED (i.e. after
  `stop()` and before the next `start()`). Modification while running is still forbidden.
- Per‑run statistics are not accumulated across restarts; each run begins with fresh counters (servers rebuilt).

Explicit `reusePort` policy:

- For `threadCount > 1` you MUST set `cfg.reusePort = true` beforehand (otherwise the constructor throws `invalid_argument`).
- For a single thread (`threadCount == 1`) `reusePort` is optional.

Move semantics: `MultiHttpServer` is movable even while running; threads capture stable addresses of `HttpServer`
elements whose storage is transferred intact during the move (vector buffer move). Restart behavior is unchanged by moves.

Single‑shot `HttpServer`: the underlying `HttpServer` type intentionally remains single‑shot for now. Supporting an in‑place
restart would require re-binding sockets, purging existing connection state, and carefully updating the epoll set.
If in‑place restart becomes a requirement a future refactor can introduce a `requestRestart()` / `rebind()` path. For most
supervisor scenarios recreating a top‑level `MultiHttpServer` or using its built‑in restart suffices.

Example:

```cpp
HttpServerConfig cfg;
cfg.port = 0;          // ephemeral
cfg.reusePort = true;  // required for >1 threads
MultiHttpServer multi(cfg, 4); // port resolved here
std::cout << multi.port() << "\n"; // valid now
multi.setHandler(...);
multi.start();
```

Notes:

- If `cfg.port` was 0 the kernel-chosen ephemeral port printed above will remain stable across any later `stop()` /
  `start()` cycles for this `MultiHttpServer` instance.
- You may modify or add path handlers (and/or replace the global handler) after `stop()` and before the next
  `start()`; attempting to do so while running throws.

#### Example

```bash
./build/examples/aeronet-multi 8080 4   # port 8080, 4 threads
```

Each thread owns its own listening socket (SO_REUSEPORT) and epoll instance – no shared locks in the accept path.
This is the simplest horizontal scaling strategy before introducing a worker pool.

### TLS Metrics Reference

Metrics example: [TLS Features](docs/FEATURES.md#tls-features)

### Accessing the Query String & Parameters

Moved to: [Query String & Parameters](docs/FEATURES.md#query-string--parameters)

Instead of manually creating N threads and N `HttpServer` instances, you can use `MultiHttpServer` to spin up a "farm" of identical servers on the same port. It:

- Accepts a base `HttpServerConfig` (set `port=0` for ephemeral bind; the chosen port is propagated to all instances)
- Forces `reusePort=true` automatically when thread count > 1
- Replicates either a global handler or all registered path handlers across each underlying server
- Exposes `stats()` returning both per-instance and aggregated totals (sums; `maxConnectionOutboundBuffer` is a max)
- Manages lifecycle with internal `std::jthread`s; `stop()` requests shutdown of every instance
- Provides the resolved listening `port()` after start (even for ephemeral port 0 requests)

Minimal example:

```cpp
#include <aeronet/aeronet.hpp>
#include <print>
using namespace aeronet;

int main() {
  HttpServerConfig cfg; cfg.port = 0; cfg.reusePort = true; // ephemeral, auto-propagated
  MultiHttpServer multi(cfg, 4); // 4 underlying event loops
  multi.setHandler([](const HttpRequest& req){
    return HttpResponse(200, "OK").body("hello\n").contentType("text/plain");
  });
  multi.start();
  // ... run until external signal ...
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(30));
  auto agg = multi.stats();
  std::print("instances={} queued={}\n", agg.per.size(), agg.total.totalBytesQueued);
  multi.stop();
}
```

### Choosing Between HttpServer, AsyncHttpServer, and MultiHttpServer

| Variant | Header | Launch API | Blocking? | Threads Created Internally | Scaling Model | Typical Use Case | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| `HttpServer` | `aeronet/http-server.hpp` | `run()` / `runUntil(pred)` | Yes (caller thread blocks) | 0 | Single reactor | Dedicated thread you manage or simple main-thread server | Minimal overhead |
| `AsyncHttpServer` | `aeronet/async-http-server.hpp` | `start()`, `startUntil(pred)`, `requestStop()`, `stopAndJoin()` | No | 1 `std::jthread` | Single reactor (owned) | Need non-blocking single server with safe lifetime | Owns server; access via `async.server()` |
| `MultiHttpServer` | `aeronet/multi-http-server.hpp` | `start()`, `stop()` | No | N (`threadCount`) | Horizontal SO_REUSEPORT multi-reactor | Scale across cores quickly | Replicates handlers pre-start |

Decision heuristics:

- Use `HttpServer` when you already own a thread (or can just block main) and want minimal abstraction.
- Use `AsyncHttpServer` when you want a single server but need the calling thread free (e.g. integrating into a service hosting multiple subsystems, or writing higher-level control logic while serving traffic).
- Use `MultiHttpServer` when you need multi-core throughput with separate event loops per core; simplest horizontal scale path before more advanced worker models.

Blocking semantics summary:

- `HttpServer::run()` / `runUntil()` – fully blocking; returns only on stop/predicate.
- `AsyncHttpServer::start()` – non-blocking; lifecycle controlled via stop token + `server.stop()`.
- `MultiHttpServer::start()` – non-blocking; returns after all reactors launched.

### AsyncHttpServer (Single-Reactor Background Wrapper)

```cpp
#include <aeronet/aeronet.hpp>
using namespace aeronet;

int main() {
  HttpServerConfig cfg; cfg.withPort(0); // ephemeral
  HttpServer server(cfg);
  server.setHandler([](const HttpRequest&){ return HttpResponse(200, "OK").body("hi").contentType("text/plain"); });

  AsyncHttpServer async(std::move(server));
  async.start();
  // main thread free to do orchestration / other work
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
  async.requestStop();
  async.stopAndJoin();
  async.rethrowIfError();
}
```

Predicate form (stop when external flag flips):

```cpp
std::atomic<bool> done{false};
AsyncHttpServer async(std::move(server));
async.startUntil([&]{ return done.load(); });
// later
done = true; // loop exits soon (bounded by poll interval)
async.stopAndJoin();
```

Notes:

- Do not call `run()` directly on the underlying `HttpServer` while an `AsyncHttpServer` is active.
- Register handlers before `start()` unless you provide external synchronization for modifications.
- `stopAndJoin()` is idempotent; destructor performs it automatically as a safety net.

Handler rules mirror `HttpServer`:

- Call `setHandler()` once OR register multiple `addPathHandler()` entries before `start()`.
- Mixing global handler with path handlers is rejected.
- After `start()`, further registration throws.

Ephemeral port binding: `multi.start()` launches threads and spin‑waits briefly until the first server resolves its kernel-assigned port (captured via `getsockname()` in the internal `HttpServer`). The resolved value is then visible via `multi.port()` and reused for all subsequent instances.

Stats aggregation example:

```cpp
auto st = multi.stats();
for (size_t i = 0; i < st.per.size(); ++i) {
  const auto& s = st.per[i];
  std::print("[srv{}] queued={} imm={} flush={}\n", i,
             s.totalBytesQueued,
             s.totalBytesWrittenImmediate,
             s.totalBytesWrittenFlush);
}
```

### Logging

Details moved to: [Logging](docs/FEATURES.md#logging)

## Streaming Responses (Chunked / Incremental)

Moved to: [Streaming Responses](docs/FEATURES.md#streaming-responses-chunked--incremental)

### Mixed Mode & Dispatch Precedence

Moved to: [Mixed Mode & Dispatch Precedence](docs/FEATURES.md#mixed-mode--dispatch-precedence)

## Configuration API (builder style)

`HttpServerConfig` lives in `aeronet/http-server-config.hpp` and exposes fluent setters (withX naming):

```cpp
HttpServerConfig cfg;
cfg.withPort(8080)
  .withReusePort(true)
  .withMaxHeaderBytes(16 * 1024)
  .withMaxBodyBytes(2 * 1024 * 1024)
  .withKeepAliveTimeout(std::chrono::milliseconds{10'000})
  .withMaxRequestsPerConnection(500)
  .withKeepAliveMode(true);

HttpServer server(cfg); // or HttpServer(8080) then server.setConfig(cfgWithoutPort);
```

Keep-alive can be disabled globally by `cfg.withKeepAliveMode(false)`; per-request `Connection: close` or `Connection: keep-alive` headers are also honored (HTTP/1.1 default keep-alive, HTTP/1.0 requires explicit header).

### Handler Registration / Routing (Detailed)

Two mutually exclusive approaches:

1. Global handler: `server.setHandler([](const HttpRequest&){ ... })` (receives every request).
2. Per-path handlers: `server.addPathHandler("/hello", http::MethodsSet{http::Method::GET, http::Method::POST}, handler)` – exact path match.

Rules:

- Mixing the two modes (calling `addPathHandler` after `setHandler` or vice-versa) throws.
- If a path is not registered -> 404 Not Found.
- If path exists but method not allowed -> 405 Method Not Allowed.
- Allowed methods are supplied as a non-allocating `http::MethodSet` (small fixed-capacity container) containing `http::Method` values.
- You can call `addPathHandler` repeatedly on the same path to extend the allowed method mask (handler is replaced, methods merged).

Example:

```cpp
HttpServer server(cfg);
server.addPathHandler("/hello", http::MethodsSet{http::Method::GET}, [](const HttpRequest&){
  HttpResponse r; r.statusCode=200; r.reason="OK"; r.body="world"; r.contentType="text/plain"; return r; });
server.addPathHandler("/echo", http::MethodsSet{http::Method::POST}, [](const HttpRequest& req){
  HttpResponse r; r.statusCode=200; r.reason="OK"; r.body=req.body; r.contentType="text/plain"; return r; });
// Add another method later (merges method mask, replaces handler)
server.addPathHandler("/echo", http::Method::GET, [](const HttpRequest& req){
  HttpResponse r; r.statusCode=200; r.reason="OK"; r.body = "Echo via GET"; r.contentType="text/plain"; return r; });
```

### Limits

- 431 is returned if the header section exceeds `maxHeaderBytes`.
- 413 is returned if the declared `Content-Length` exceeds `maxBodyBytes`.
- Connections exceeding `maxOutboundBufferBytes` (buffered pending write bytes) are marked to close after flush (default 4MB) to prevent unbounded memory growth if peers stop reading.
- Slowloris protection: configure `withHeaderReadTimeout(ms)` to bound how long a client may take to send an entire request head (request line + headers). 0 disables.

### Performance / Metrics & Backpressure

`HttpServer::stats()` exposes aggregated counters:

- `totalBytesQueued` – bytes accepted into outbound buffering (including those sent immediately)
- `totalBytesWrittenImmediate` – bytes written synchronously on first attempt (no buffering)
- `totalBytesWrittenFlush` – bytes written during later flush cycles (EPOLLOUT)
- `deferredWriteEvents` – number of times EPOLLOUT was registered due to pending data
- `flushCycles` – number of flush attempts triggered by writable events
- `maxConnectionOutboundBuffer` – high-water mark of any single connection's buffered bytes

Use these to gauge backpressure behavior and tune `maxOutboundBufferBytes`. When a connection's pending buffer would exceed the configured maximum, it is marked for closure once existing data flushes, preventing unbounded memory growth under slow-reader scenarios.

### Metrics Callback (Scaffold)

You can install a lightweight per-request metrics callback capturing basic timing and size information:

```cpp
server.setMetricsCallback([](const HttpServer::RequestMetrics& m){
  // Export to stats sink / log
  // m.method, m.target, m.status, m.bytesIn, m.bytesOut (currently 0 for fixed responses), m.duration, m.reusedConnection
});
```

Current fields (alpha – subject to change before 1.0):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| method | Original request method string |
| target | Request target (decoded path) |
| status | Response status code (best-effort 200 for streaming if not overridden) |
| bytesIn | Request body size (after chunk decode) |
| bytesOut | Placeholder (0 for now, future: capture flushed bytes per response) |
| duration | Wall time from parse completion to response dispatch end (best effort) |
| reusedConnection | True if this connection previously served other request(s) |

The callback runs in the event loop thread – keep it non-blocking.

### Test HTTP Client Helper

The test suite uses a unified helper for simple GETs, streaming incremental reads, and multi-request keep-alive batches. See `docs/test-client-helper.md` for guidance when adding new tests.
