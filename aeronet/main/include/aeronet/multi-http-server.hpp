// MultiHttpServer: convenience wrapper that spins up N HttpServer instances
// (each with its own event loop) listening on the same port via SO_REUSEPORT.
// Threads start in start(); they are std::jthread so they auto-join on destruction.
// Handlers must be registered before start(). Post-start registration throws.
// NOTE: This class is intentionally NOT thread-safe. It assumes a single controlling
// thread performs construction, handler registration, start(), stats() calls and stop().
// Dropping the mutex avoids unnecessary synchronization on the hot path of start/stop.
//
// Restart semantics:
//  - MultiHttpServer can be restarted: after stop() you may call start() again. A restart constructs
//    a fresh set of underlying HttpServer instances (HttpServer itself is currently single-shot; its
//    stop() closes the listening socket). Handlers registered prior to the *first* start() are retained;
//    you may also replace the global handler between stops. The same port is reused unless you set
//    _baseConfig.port = 0 (via an external config mutation API in the future) before restarting, in which
//    case a new ephemeral port will be chosen and propagated.
//  - Stats from previous runs are not accumulated across restarts because the underlying servers are rebuilt.

  // Construct a MultiHttpServer that does nothing.
  // Useful only to make it default constructible for temporary purposes (for instance to move assign to it later on),
  // but do not attempt to use a default constructed server, it will not bind to any socket.
  MultiHttpServer() noexcept = default;

  // Construct a MultiHttpServer wrapper.
  // Parameters:
  //   cfg          - Base HttpServerConfig applied to each underlying HttpServer. If cfg.port == 0 an
  //                  ephemeral port is chosen by the first server; that resolved port is then
  //                  propagated to all subsequent servers so the entire group listens on the same
  //                  concrete port.
  //   threadCount  - Number of HttpServer instances (and dedicated threads) to launch. Must be >= 1.
  //                  Each instance owns an independent epoll/event loop and shares the listening
  //                  port via SO_REUSEPORT (automatically enabled if threadCount > 1).
  // Behavior:
  //   - Does NOT start the servers; call start() explicitly after registering handlers.
  //   - Validates threadCount and throws std::invalid_argument if < 1.
  //   - The object itself is NOT thread-safe; expect single-threaded orchestration.
  // Performance rationale:
  //   - Avoids locks by treating start()/stop()/handler registration as single-threaded control
  //     operations; the hot path remains inside individual HttpServer event loops.

  // possible). You can verify how many threads were chosen after construction of this instance thanks to nbThreads()
  // method.
  explicit MultiHttpServer(HttpServerConfig cfg);

  // MultiHttpServer is moveable. Rationale:
  //   - Threads capture ONLY raw pointers to stable HttpServer elements stored inside the
  //     _servers std::vector. A move of std::vector transfers ownership of the underlying buffer
  //     without relocating elements (no per-element move), so the addresses remain valid.
  //   - The std::jthread objects are likewise moved; their destructor (join) will occur when the
  //     destination MultiHttpServer is destroyed or stop() is called there.
  //   - The moved-from instance becomes empty (no threads, no servers) and its destructor does
  //     nothing.
  // Constraints:
  //   - Still non-copyable.
  //   - Move assignment will stop() an already-running target before adopting new threads.

  //   - Must be set before start(); post-start modification throws.

  //   - The callback is copied into each server at start() time.

  //   resolve a concrete port, then propagates that port to subsequent instances so the entire
  //   group listens on a single shared port.
  // Error handling:
  //   - Throws std::logic_error if called more than once.
  //   - Exceptions during individual HttpServer::run() are logged; that thread exits but others
  //     continue (future improvement could surface an aggregated failure signal).

  //   - isRunning() returns true if startup sequence completed.
  //   - Handler registration becomes immutable after this call.
