// (each with its own event loop) listening on the same port via SO_REUSEPORT.
// Threads start in start(); they are std::jthread so they auto-join on destruction.
// Handlers must be registered before start(). Post-start registration throws.
// NOTE: This class is intentionally NOT thread-safe. It assumes a single controlling
// thread performs construction, handler registration, start(), stats() calls and stop().
// Dropping the mutex avoids unnecessary synchronization on the hot path of start/stop.

  MultiHttpServer() noexcept = default;

  // Construct a MultiHttpServer wrapper.
  // Parameters:
  //   cfg          - Base HttpServerConfig applied to each underlying HttpServer. If cfg.port == 0 an
  //                  ephemeral port is chosen by the first server; that resolved port is then
  //                  propagated to all subsequent servers so the entire group listens on the same
  //                  concrete port.
  //   threadCount  - Number of HttpServer instances (and dedicated threads) to launch. Must be >= 1.
  //                  Each instance owns an independent epoll/event loop and shares the listening
  //                  port via SO_REUSEPORT (automatically enabled if threadCount > 1).
  // Behavior:
  //   - Does NOT start the servers; call start() explicitly after registering handlers.
  //   - Validates threadCount and throws invalid_argument if < 1.
  //   - The object itself is NOT thread-safe; expect single-threaded orchestration.
  // Performance rationale:
  //   - Avoids locks by treating start()/stop()/handler registration as single-threaded control
  //     operations; the hot path remains inside individual HttpServer event loops.

  // Move semantics & lifecycle constraints:
  // ---------------------------------------
  // MultiHttpServer may be moved ONLY while it has not been started yet (i.e. before start()).
  // Once start() is invoked, each underlying HttpServer instance address is captured by its
  // dedicated std::jthread via a raw pointer. Moving the enclosing container would relocate
  // the vector storage and invalidate those pointers, leading to immediate undefined behavior.
  // For safety we assert+log if a move (construction or assignment) is attempted on a running
  // instance. This mirrors the HttpServer move policy.

  // setHandler:
  //   Registers a single global handler applied to all successfully parsed requests on every
  //   underlying HttpServer instance. Mutually exclusive with addPathHandler registrations.
  // Constraints:
  //   - Must be invoked before start().
  //   - Throws std::logic_error if path handlers have already been added.
  // Threading:
  //   - Not thread-safe; call from the controlling thread only.
  // Replacement:
  //   - May be called multiple times pre-start; the last handler wins.

  //   Registers a handler for a given absolute path and a fixed set of allowed HTTP methods.
  // Behavior:
  //   - Paths are matched exactly (no globbing / parameter extraction in current phase).
  //   - The supplied MethodSet is converted to an internal method bitmask for dispatch speed.
  // Constraints:
  //   - Must be called before start().
  //   - Incompatible with a previously set global handler (logic_error if violated).
  // Multiple registrations:
  //   - Re-registering the same path overwrites the previous mapping for the specified methods.

  // setParserErrorCallback:
  //   Installs a callback invoked by each underlying HttpServer when a parser error occurs
  //   (see HttpServer::ParserError). Used for centralized metrics or logging.
  // Constraints:
  //   - Must be set before start(); post-start modification throws.
  // Lifetime:
  //   - The callback is copied into each server at start() time.
  // Clearing:
  //   - Pass an empty std::function to clear prior to start().

  // start():
  //   Launches the configured number of HttpServer instances, each on its own std::jthread.
  //   Enables SO_REUSEPORT automatically when threadCount > 1 (overrides cfg.reusePort=false).
  //   For ephemeral ports (cfg.port==0): waits (busy sleep up to ~200ms) for the first server to
  //   resolve a concrete port, then propagates that port to subsequent instances so the entire
  //   group listens on a single shared port.
  // Error handling:
  //   - Throws std::logic_error if called more than once.
  //   - Exceptions during individual HttpServer::run() are logged; that thread exits but others
  //     continue (future improvement could surface an aggregated failure signal).
  // Post-conditions:
  //   - isRunning() returns true if startup sequence completed.
  //   - Handler registration becomes immutable after this call.

  // stop():
  //   Signals all underlying servers to stop, then joins their threads (via std::jthread RAII
  //   on scope exit of internal moves). Safe to call multiple times; subsequent calls are no-ops.
  //   Blocks until all servers have exited their event loops. Ensures HttpServer objects outlive
  //   the joining of their threads (ordering guaranteed by move+scope pattern in implementation).
  void stop();

  // isRunning(): true after successful start() and before stop() completion.
  //   Reflects the high-level lifecycle, not the liveness of each individual thread (a thread
  //   may have terminated due to an exception while isRunning() is still true). Use stats() or
  //   external health checks for deeper diagnostics.

  // stats():
  //   Collects statistics from each underlying HttpServer and returns both per-instance and
  //   aggregated totals. Costs O(N) in number of servers and should be used sparingly in hot
  //   telemetry paths. Thread-safe for read-only access under assumption that start()/stop()
  //   are not racing with this call (class not fully synchronized).

  //   1. Local 'threads' (moved from _threads) is destroyed FIRST (joins threads) while servers are still alive.
  //   2. Local 'servers' (moved from _servers) is destroyed AFTER 'threads', releasing HttpServer objects safely.
