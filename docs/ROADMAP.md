7. Enhanced Parser Diagnostics (byte offset)
8. Structured Logging Interface (pluggable sinks / structured fields)
9. brotli compression (if demand) and streaming compression integration
10. TLS termination (OpenSSL minimal)
11. Fuzz Harness (extended corpus / sanitizer CI)

## Design Sketches

### HttpResponseWriter (Streaming)

```cpp
class HttpResponseWriter {
public:
  void setStatus(http::StatusCode code, std::string_view reason = {});
  void addHeader(std::string_view name, std::string_view value);
  void setContentLength(std::size_t bytes); // optional explicit length
  void beginChunked();                       // switch to chunked transfer
  bool write(std::string_view chunk);        // returns false if output buffer full
  void end();                                // finalize (send last-chunk if chunked)
};
```

Handler variant:

```cpp
server.setStreamingHandler([](const HttpRequest& req, HttpResponseWriter& w){
  w.setStatus(200, "OK");
  w.addHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  w.beginChunked();
  for (auto piece : pieces) w.write(piece);
  w.end();
});
```

### Metrics Callback

```cpp
struct RequestMetrics {
  std::string_view method;
  std::string_view target;
  int status;
  uint64_t bytesIn;
  uint64_t bytesOut;
  std::chrono::nanoseconds duration;
  bool reusedConnection;
};
server.setMetricsCallback([](const RequestMetrics& m){ /* export */ });
```

### Backpressure Model

- Attempt writev; if partial, store remaining (flatten into buffer or keep iovec queue).
- Register EPOLLOUT; on writable, continue draining.
- While pending output exists, do not read/parse new requests (fairness + ordering).
- Configurable cap: `withMaxWriteBufferBytes(size_t)`; exceed -> connection marked to close after flush (current behavior) or future configurable strategy (e.g., 503).

### Compression Design Notes (Planned)

Phased approach:

1. Negotiation: Parse `Accept-Encoding` (simple token scan) ‚Äì support `identity` and `gzip` initially.
2. Threshold & Eligibility: Only compress for bodies over configurable N bytes and for explicit content-types (e.g., text/*, application/json). Allow user-supplied predicate.
3. Implementation: Use zlib / miniz (header-only) optional dependency guarded by CMake option; fallback to identity if library absent.
4. Streaming Integration: When streaming API active and no Content-Length known, wrap writes through compressor producing chunked output automatically.
5. Buffering Strategy: Small sliding window 8‚Äì32KB; flush on end() or when output buffer would exceed high-water mark.
6. Stats: Track compressed vs original bytes (ratio) per request metrics structure.
7. Future: Add brotli (static dictionary optional) once gzip path stable.

## Testing Roadmap Highlights

| Feature | Test Concepts |
|---------|---------------|
| Write Buffer | Mock partial writes (small SO_SNDBUF), ensure complete delivery |
| Streaming | Chunk correctness, HEAD suppression, large sequence writes |
| Header Timeout | Byte drip slower than threshold -> close/408 |
| sendfile | File integrity, large file partial cycles |
| Compression | Accept-Encoding negotiation, size reduced |
| Trailers | Map contains trailers, limit enforcement |
| Metrics | Accumulate counts across keep-alive reuse |
| TLS | Handshake + basic GET with self-signed cert |

## TLS Roadmap (Detailed)

Status Legend Recap: ‚úÖ done, üõ† in progress, ‚è≥ planned, ‚ùÑ deferred

### Phase 1 (Implemented ‚úÖ)

- Optional build flag `AERONET_ENABLE_OPENSSL`; core headers free of OpenSSL types.
- Transport abstraction (`ITransport`, `PlainTransport`, `TlsTransport`).
- Basic server-side handshake using OpenSSL with lazy negotiation on first IO.
- Self-signed ephemeral cert integration test (`http_tls_basic`).
- Clean teardown ordering (no ASAN leaks) and graceful SSL_shutdown best-effort.

### Phase 2 (Robustness & Event Loop Integration)

1. Correct EPOLL re-registration on TLS WANT_* events (partially handled; needs audit for write side fairness)
2. TLS partial write & unified buffering (currently plain path stronger; align semantics)
3. Refined backpressure for TLS WANT_WRITE (throttle earlier vs large queue growth)
4. Failure categorization metrics (alert vs timeout vs EOF)

### Phase 3 (Security Hardening)

- Enforce secure defaults (now configurable min/max present; default policy tightening TBD)
- Curate cipher suites: AES-GCM + CHACHA20-POLY1305; remove legacy / CBC by default (current: user-provided)
- Explicit TLS 1.3 cipher suites optional field (future) + validation
- Enforce strong key sizes; reject RSA < 2048.
- Disable compression (defense vs CRIME) explicitly via options (should be off by default).
- Add structured error reporting mapping OpenSSL error codes / alerts -> internal enums.

### Phase 4 (Feature Expansion)

- Client Certificate Authentication (mTLS):
  - Config: CA file/dir, verify depth, optional enforcement flag.
  - Expose verification result to handler (e.g., peer subject) or set 4xx on failure.
- ALPN Support: (DONE) foundation laid for future HTTP/2
- Session Resumption:
  - Enable session tickets; rotating ticket key (time-based) or disable by default.
  - Metrics: resumed vs full handshakes.
- Hot Certificate Reload:
  - Atomic swap of `SSL_CTX` created off-thread; reference counting with shared_ptr.

### Phase 5 (Advanced Capabilities / Nice-to-Have ‚ùÑ)

- OCSP Stapling (configurable staple file / refresh strategy).
- 0-RTT (TLS 1.3 early data) ‚Äì only after idempotency safeguards.
- Key logging hook (for debugging) behind explicit insecure flag.
- Curve preference and explicit group selection.
- Session cache statistics & custom callbacks.

### Phase 6 (Observability & Tooling)

- Metrics: (PARTIAL) success, client cert presence, ALPN mismatch, distributions, durations implemented; remaining: failures by category, active TLS counts, resume stats.
- Logging: (PARTIAL) handshake success line implemented; add failure reason path.
- Tracing hooks: optional compile-time enable for per-handshake spans.

### Testing Matrix Additions

| Category | Test Cases |
|----------|------------|
| Negative Handshakes | Invalid cert path, mismatched key, expired cert, unsupported protocol version |
| mTLS | Required client cert missing, invalid CA, successful mutual auth |
| ALPN | Client offers [h2, http/1.1]; server selects http/1.1 |
| Session Resumption | Full then resumed handshake (check `SSL_session_reused`) |
| Backpressure | Force small SO_SNDBUF; verify no busy loop with WANT_WRITE |
| Stress | N concurrent TLS clients, large payload streaming & rapid connect/disconnect |
| Hot Reload | Swap cert mid-run; new connections use new chain, existing unaffected |

### Open Implementation Tasks (Updated Snapshot)

- [ ] WANT_{READ,WRITE} epoll path audit (optimize removal of EPOLLOUT after TLS flush)
- [ ] TLS partial write alignment with plain transport buffering
- [ ] Failure metrics (timeouts vs alerts vs peer close)
- [ ] Cipher suite policy helper (secure default set if user omits list)
- [ ] TLS 1.3 cipher suites explicit config (optional)
- [ ] Session tickets (enable/disable + resumed handshake metrics)
- [ ] SNI multi-cert / context switching
- [ ] Hot cert/key reload (atomic swap)
- [ ] Active TLS connection gauge
- [ ] Handshake p50/p95 latency snapshot (histogram or rolling window)
- [ ] HTTP/2 prototype (leveraging existing ALPN & transport abstraction)
- [ ] Revocation / OCSP stapling support

### Notes

- Keep OpenSSL usage fully isolated inside `tls/` to maintain optional dependency nature.
- Avoid scattering `#ifdef AERONET_ENABLE_OPENSSL` outside TLS boundary except for narrow integration points.
- Future HTTP/2 work will depend on ALPN; design ALPN config with extensibility in mind.


## Open Questions

- Should streaming handler coexist with existing handler (dispatch precedence) or replace it? (Proposed: allow both; pick streaming if a streaming handler is set.)
- Provide synchronous `write()` only, or future-based async? (Initial: synchronous + backpressure boolean.)
- Expose per-chunk flush hints? (Defer until performance tuning.)

## Contribution Notes

- Keep public API additions guarded behind incremental commits with tests.
- Preserve single-thread invariant; multi-thread scaling remains multi-reactor.
- Avoid introducing blocking syscalls in hot path (except unavoidable kernel I/O).
